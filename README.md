# Console-Finances

## Introduction

In this challenge, I'll be using the concepts you've learned to complete the required activity. This activity presents a real-world situation in which your newfound JavaScript skills will come in handy. I am tasked with creating code for analyzing the financial records of a company. I have been provided with a financial dataset in the `starter/index.js` file.

## Description

I have been given a dataset composed of arrays with two fields, Date and Profit/Losses.
My task was to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

- The total number of months included in the dataset.
- The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
- The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
  * You will need to track what the total change in profits are from month to month and then find the average.
  * (`Total/Number of months`)
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

When you open your code in the browser my resulting analysis should look similar to the following:

  ```text
  Financial Analysis
  ----------------------------
  Total Months: 25
  Total: $2561231
  Average  Change: $-2315.12
  Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
  Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
  ```

To solve the following challenge, I started by creating a plan to follow which allowed me to follow a clear path and not try to do "some here some there". 
The plan was the following:
- Solve the first value using knowledge acquire during lectures 
- As sum of values in array was not covered during the lecture, search online possible methods that would help coding the second, third and fourth question
- Multiple console logs to check if values made sense
- After correct has been defined to find values, add code to round to the nearest 100th
- Add comments to the code
- Push code and deploy webpage on GitHub
